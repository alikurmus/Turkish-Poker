    "This is my CS Internal Assesment project.\n",
    "The format of the project requires that I have a client who asks for a certain deliverable which I provide by using the things I learned in my CS class. My client wanted two things: two tables showing the chances of winning for different hands in Turkish poker and simple program that will tell him how much to bet given a certain hand, a pot size, and the stage of the game.\n",
    "To complete the assignment, I did four things:\n",
    "1. Wrote a Python program that can simulate Turkish Poker games and record the results in a file.\n",
    "2. Analyzed the results of the simualted hands using the Pandas data analysis library.\n",
    "3. Used the output of the analysis to prepare a nice looking table for the client.\n",
    "4. Used the output of the analysis to write a simple program that suggests how much to bet."

    "Turkish poker is a 5 Card Draw poker variant played with a short deck of 32 cards. Each player receives five cards and up to four can be exchanged.\n",
    "### Players and Cards\n",
    "Although between 2 and 5 players can play the game, for the purposes of this brief, we will only look at the 4 player variety. In the four player variety, there are thirty two cards, A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7 of each suit.\n",
    "The Ace is normally the highest card, but can be used as a low card to make a straight (or straight flush). When used as a low card the Ace ranks immediately below the lowest card in the pack - for example with four players the Ace ranks immediately below the 7 and 10-9-8-7-A is a straight.\n",
    "The rank of the suits, from high to low, is: Hearts, Diamonds , Spades, and Clubs.\n",
    "### Names and Ranks of Hands\n",
    "Note that there are four important differences from international poker:\n",
    "1. A flush beats a full house (flushes are more difficult to make with a shortened deck).\n",
    "2. Three of a kind beats a straight (straights are easier make with a shortened deck).\n",
    "3. Aces are considered consecutive with the lowest card of the deck when making a low (minor) straight.\n",
    "4. In other cases, suits are used to break ties between otherwise equal hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the hand types in order from highest to lowest and notes on how to compare them when two or more players have the same type of hand.\n",
    "1. Straight Flush: five consecutive cards of a suit. For example ♠️K – ♠️Q – ♠️J – ♠️10 – ♠️9. An Ace can be used instead of 6 making a Ace Low Straight Flush such as ♠️10 – ♠️9-♠️8 – ♠️7-♠️A. When comparing straight flushes, first compare the rank or the highest card. In Ace Low Straight Flushes, the highest card is the 10, not the Ace. If the ranks are the same, the suit of the highest card determines the winner.\n",
    "2. Four of a Kind: four equal ranked cards, with any fifth card, for example ♥️K - ♠️K - ♦️K - ♣️K - ♠️9. When comparing these, the higher set of four is better.\n",
    "3. Flush: any five cards of the same suit, such as ♣️A – ♣️Q – ♣️10 – ♣️9 – ♣️7. When comparing two flushes, compare the rank of the highest card, then the second highest and so on down; if all five cards are equal the suit decides. For example ♣️A – ♣️Q – ♣️J – ♣️8 – ♣️7 is better than ♥️A - ♥️Q - ♥️10 - ♥️9 - ♥️8 because the Jack is higher than the 10.\n",
    "4. Full House: three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank, such as ♠️8 – ♦️8 – ♣️8 – ♥️J – ♣️J. When comparing these, the higher three of a kind is better.\n",
    "5. Three of a kind: three cards of the same rank plus two unequal cards, such as ♥️9 – ♦️9 – ♣️9 – ♠️J – ♦️Q. When comparing these, the higher three of a kind is better.\n",
    "6. Straight: five consecutive cards of mixed suits, such as ♣️A - ♦️K - ♠️Q - ♠️J - ♥️10 or ♦️Q – ♦️J – ♠️10 - ♣️9 - ♥️8.  Ace can be used instead of a 6 making an Ace Low Straight, in which case the 10 is considered the highest card of the straighht. The straight with the higher top card is better. If the high cards are equal, the suit of the 10 decides the winner (every straight has a 10).\n",
    "7. Two Pairs: two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank, and one other card - for example ♣️A – ♠️A – ♥️J – ♦️J - ♣️8. First compare the higher pair, then the lower pair, then the odd card. If the rank of all three groups are equal, the suit of the odd card determines the winner.\n",
    "8. Pair: two cards of the same rank and three odd cards. For example ♥️Q – ♦️Q – ♣️K – ♠️7 - ♦️8. Compare the rank of the pairs, then the rank of the odd cards, beginning with the highest. Only if all five cards are equal, the suit of the highest odd card determines the winner.\n",
    "9. High Card: five cards that do not form any of the above combinations - for example ♠️A – ♥️J – ♣️10 – ♠️8 - ♥️7. Compare the rank of the highest card, then the second highest and so on. If all ranks are equal, the suit of the highest card decides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deal and First Betting Round\n",
    "The first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand. Before each deal all players must ante an equal amount to the pot.\n",
    "The cards are shuffled, cut, and dealt clockwise one at a time until each player has five cards.\n",
    "At this point there is a round of betting, in which the minimum requirement to open is a pair of Kings. Players who have less than this must pass, and players are allowed to pass even if they meet the opening requirement.\n",
    "Once a player has opened, other players can call , raise or re-raise even without a pair of kings. Players who do not wish to match the latest bet can fold. They throw in their cards face down, take no further part in the hand, and cannot win the pot. Note that if the opener folds, he or she may be required to show enough cards to prove that the opening was legal - i.e. that the hand was higher than a pair of Queens.\n",
    "If all players but one fold, the sole survivor wins the pot immediately (if it is the opener, the winner may be required to show cards to prove that the opening requirement was met). Otherwise, the betting round continues until the stakes of all surviving players are equal.\n",
    "If nobody opens, the cards are thrown in. The pot stays, the players ante again and there is a new deal by the next dealer.\n",
    "### Betting Principles\n",
    "The bets are made by moving chips into a central area called the pot. In Turkish Poker there there are two betting rounds, during which the game play is paused while the players take turns to place a bet. Players who wish to stay in must at least match the other players' bets. These are the active players. A player who is unwilling to match the other players' bets can fold, dropping out of the action and abandoning any chance to win the chips in the pot. The betting round normally ends when the total amounts bet by all the active players are equal. If at any stage there is only one active player, that player immediately wins the pot. Otherwise, after the last betting round, the pot is won by the active player who holds the best hand.\n",
    "The possible actions are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check**\n",
    "If no one has bet so far in the current betting round, a player can remain active without adding any chips to the pot. In this situation, if no one opens the betting but all players pass (or check), normally the cards are thrown in and the turn to deal passes to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bet**\n",
    "If no one has bet so far in the current betting round, a player can announce \"bet\" followed by an amount, and push chips to that value into the pool. Betting in the first round, when the previous players have all checked (passed), is known as opening the betting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Call**\n",
    "Any bet or raise must be at least matched by other players who wish to remain active. A player who wants to match the latest bet or raise without raising the stake further announces “call\" and adds enough chips to the pot to make his or her bet equal to that of the player who most recently bet or raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Raise**\n",
    "After a bet or raise, another player may raise the stake further. The player announces \"raise\" followed by the amount by which they wish to raise, and must then add to the pot the amount required to call plus the amount of the raise they announced. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fold**\n",
    "A player who does not wish to match the latest bet or raise can fold or drop, by announcing this and discarding his or her cards face down. Players who have folded do not get any further turns in this or subsequent betting rounds and cannot win the pot. It is legal to fold even when there has not been a bet or raise - this is known as \"checking out\" - but there is generally no good reason to do this, since you could remain active without spending any extra chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Draw and Second Betting Round\n",
    "If more than one player is still in the game after the first betting round, the players have an opportunity to improve their hands by drawing cards.\n",
    "Beginning with the player to dealer's left each player states how many cards, from 0 to 4, he or she wishes to exchange, discards that number of cards face down and is given replacement cards by the dealer from the top of the remaining part of the deck. If the cards run out, the discarded cards are shuffled and reused. If a player wishes to change four cards, only three are given initially; after all the players have been served, the players who asked for four cards are given their last replacement card.\n",
    "As in standard draw poker, it is legal for the opener to discard part of or all of the combination that qualified the hand to be opened. In this case, the player must announce that the opening combination is being discarded, and the dealer must keep that player's discards to one side, so that it can be proved if necessary that a pair of kings or better was held.\n",
    "After the exchange of cards are there is a second round of betting begun by the player who opened the first round of betting, or if this player has folded by the next player in clockwise order from the opener who is still active. This player may check, leaving his or her stake as it is, or bet, putting some additional money in the pot. If everyone checks, the showdown follows immediately. If a player bets, the other players have the usual options to fold, call or raise.\n",
    "If all but one player fold, the sole survivor takes the pot immediately. Otherwise, the betting round continues until the stakes of all surviving players are equal, and then the cards are shown.\n",
    "As in the first betting round, if the opener folds or wins because everyone else folds, he or she must show cards on request to prove that the opening was legal.\n",
    "### The Showdown\n",
    "In the showdown, all surviving players show their hands, and the player with the highest ranked hand wins the pot.\n",
